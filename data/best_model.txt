- Includes methods for dynamic channel adjustment

2. U-NET ARCHITECTURE:
- Downsampling path with 4 levels (UnetDown blocks)
- Upsampling path with skip connections (UnetUp blocks)
- Context embedding for conditional generation
- Time embedding for diffusion timesteps

3. CONTEXT EMBEDDING:
- EmbedFC class for embedding context labels
- Supports 6-dimensional context features (n_cfeat=6)
- Time embedding for diffusion process timesteps

4. CUSTOM DATASET:
- Handles NumPy arrays for image and label data
- Supports 64x64 pixel images
