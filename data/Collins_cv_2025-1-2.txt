Project : Machine Learning Techniques to Predict the Seeing Condi- tion on the South African Large Telescope (SALT). Work Experience Department of Physics Tutor , University of Cape Town 2023 – Present •Tutoring science students and demonstrating physics labs. •Providing supervision on computation and report writing. NITheCS Intern , National Institute for Theoretical and Computa- tional Sciences Dec 2023 – Jan 2024 •Worked on theoretical data computation and problem-solving. •Conducted research on theoretical computation methodologies. Projects Emulating Large Scale HI Maps with Diffusion Models Model: Score-based Diffusion Models •I developed and trained diffusion models to generate high-fidelity HI maps for astrophysical research. •This successfully emulated large-scale HI maps with improved accuracy compared to previous approaches. •Contributed to more efficient simulations in astrophysics, aiding large-scale structure studies. Predicting Seeing Conditions for Observatories Model: Predictive Modeling •I developed a machine learning model during my honors research to predict atmospheric seeing conditions. •I successfully created a robust model that forecasts seeing con- ditions with high accuracy based on meteorological data. •This work helped improve scheduling and efficiency for astro- nomical observations by optimizing telescope usage.
